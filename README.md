# MLCourse-INFN-2021

Material for the INFN Course 'Big Data and ML' - October 11-15 2021

## Pre-requisites

- Basic knowledge of python 

## Before the course starts

- We will be using python, in particular I advise you to get familiar with Jupyter notebooks, numpy and pandas before the course starts. No expert knowledge is required, but doing a couple of tutorials on these topics (easily found on the web) is highly recommended.
- Try to login and get familiar with the INFN cloud, see this [guide](https://guides.cloud.infn.it/docs/users-guides/en/latest/users_guides/getting_started.html)


## Practicalities

- The course will take place remotely due to COVID restrictions. 
   - We will use [zoom](https://cern.zoom.us/j/405151509)
   - Please try it before the course starts, so that you're setup.
- Every day we will have a mixture of theoretical and hands-on sessions. 

## Hands-on session

- point your browser to https://my.cloud.infn.it/
- you will need to authenticate through your INFN IAM account (please read [this](#before-the-course-starts) first)
- on the first day, open a terminal and clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/leggerf/MLCourse-INFN-2021.git
```
- The Jupyter notebook documentation can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)
