# MLCourse-INFN-2021

- The course will take place on October 11-15 2021, from 10-12 and 14-16
- Course schedule [here](#schedule)
- This repository contains material (notebooks and slides) for the INFN CCR Course 'Big Data and ML' 

## Pre-requisites

- Basic knowledge of python 

## Practicalities

- The course will take place remotely due to COVID restrictions. 
   - We will use [zoom](https://cern.zoom.us/j/405151509)
   - Please try it before the course starts, so that you're setup.
- Every day we will have a mixture of theoretical and hands-on sessions. 

## Hands-on session

- please read [this](#before-the-course-starts) first
- point your browser to the link we provided you. It looks something like https://jhub.some.ip.address.myip.cloud.infn.it/
- on the first day, open a terminal and clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/leggerf/MLCourse-INFN-2021.git
```
- The Jupyter notebook documentation can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) 

## Before the course starts

- We will be using python, in particular I advise you to get familiar with Jupyter notebooks, numpy and pandas before the course starts. No expert knowledge is required, but doing a couple of tutorials on these topics (easily found on the web) is highly recommended.
- The hands-on will be done on the INFN cloud. Please follow the instructions below and let us know if you have issues.
 
### Access to INFN Cloud

- if you are already an INFN cloud user, let us know. We need to add you to the resource group for this course
- if you never used INFN cloud, you need to register: 
   - Please follow these [steps](https://guides.cloud.infn.it/docs/users-guides/en/latest/users_guides/getting_started.html#registration-in-the-infn-cloud-iam).
   - in the notes, specify that you're asking for access to participate in the Big Data and ML course

### Access to JupyterHub

-  You will receive by email a link to your Jhub. The url looks something like https://jhub.some.ip.address.myip.cloud.infn.it/
   -  Click on the link, and accept any security exceptions you might get
   - you will need to authenticate with IAM
   - you will get to a page that says “Authentication required for …”, click on “Authorize”
   - When you get to the server creation page, chooose the option: “Large - 4CPU 8GB”
   - It might take a few minutes for the server to start
   - in case you get timeout errors, and server creation fails, simply reload the link and try againL
